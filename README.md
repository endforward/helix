#helix


Helix is a open source .net framework that you could view as a CMS on sterioids. having worked with numerous CMS's there are a couple of recuring problems:
* The CMS framework libraries are required in the front-end causing huge bloated applications
* CMS vendors tend to focus on adding flashy functionalities that powerpoint well during sales pitches instead of improving the core
* CMS's tend to see the world as a hierarical data structure. While most sites are a combination of hierarchical navigation/template structures with collections for the actual data items
* CMS's often don't have good support for migrating datatypes and content itself between different environments leading to this being a error prone and time consuming manual process
* Licence costs or for free ones the UI feels cheap and or the API's are not very well designed

## Core Components
### Datamodeling
### Content/data management user interface
### Content/data management security
### Cron jobs
### Import/Export
Most customers still do allot with Excel so why not implement first class support for importing and exporting data using Excel/CSV
### Open API
